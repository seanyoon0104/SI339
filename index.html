    <p>I am a junior-standing student at the School of Information in the University of Michigan. I was born in South Korea but moved to America when I was 12. Since then, I have been in Texas, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. I am interested in analyzing data to get insights and make better decisions.</p>

    <p>Previously I worked at the recruitment company called <a href = "http://vpartners.com/">Variant Partners</a> as an IT intern. I also worked with <a href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/people/nia-dowell">Nia Dowell</a>, a post-doctoral researcher at the Univeristy of Michigan School of Information, as a research assistant.</p>

    <p>For this summer, I will be interning at the <a href = "https://jobs.nike.com/nike-world-headquarters-oregon">Nike World Headquarter</a> as Analytics Intern.</p>
